> ⚠️ PRETTY MUCH DEAD PROJECT ⚠️
> This project is not far from finished, but it's an 'old' project and I don't really want to work on it anymore.  
> It already has pretty much all the feature, it is just coded like garbage.
> You can still pretty easily rip code from it (like the database system, the file manager, the communication manager, the action manager etc.)
